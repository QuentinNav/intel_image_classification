# intel image classification

Project made from the kaggle dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification


* It is a multiclass image classification of urban and natural environments. 
* To get the best results I tried different CNN models such as VGG, ResNet, Inception...
* I then tried to create ensembles of the best performing models which achieved similar but not better results. 
* The model with the best results for the test dataset is ResNet101 with an accuracy of 92.4%.
